After learning kubernetes and managing a production cluster for some time, I have picked up a few tools that have helped me along the way.

Shoutout to https://nubenetes.com/ for collecting a much more extensive list than I have.


## In Cluster

- helm CRDs for installing heml charts using kubectl
- k3s as the actual cluster

## Configuration

- [cue](https://cuelang.org)
- [jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/)
- [jk](https://jkcfg.github.io/)
- ansible
