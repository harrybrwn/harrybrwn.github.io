After learning kubernetes and managing a production cluster for some time, I have picked up a few tools that have helped me along the way.

Shoutout to <https://nubenetes.com/> for collecting a much more extensive list than I have.


## In Cluster

- [helm CRDs](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/) for installing heml charts using kubectl
- [k3s](https://k3s.io/) as the actual cluster

## Configuration

- [cue](https://cuelang.org)
- [jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/)
- [jk](https://jkcfg.github.io/)
- [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
