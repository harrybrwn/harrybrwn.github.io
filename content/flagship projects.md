I am one of those people that keeps themselves busy with at least one activity
at any given time. Most people are. But I think I have the slightly less common
habit when it comes to my hobbies of having many but being particularly obsessed
with only one. When I become invested in a one of these hobbies it is almost
always because of one projects. One project that becomes my identity and my
drive to keep learning and growing in that hobby. This is what I call the
**flagship project**.
