"Abstract" usually has a pretty specific meaning in common vernacular. Since
most definitions seem to lack a lot of important details, I have come up with my own
definition of abstract, which is:

> A representation of a thing or idea that contains just enough information to evoke the original but not enough to have any literal resemblance of the original.

## Existing Definitions

Official definitions found online and in dictionaries are all fairly incomplete
but I think this one encompasses most of them quite well. The best definitions
usually imply that there is something missing, one of the better ones that does
this is:

> Existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence.

This definition misses the mark in my opinion because there are plenty of
thoughts and ideas that have room to be abstracted. Many forms of strategic
planning have many details that can be bundled into a single cohesive idea. An
example of this is The Art of War by Sun Tzu and its many succinct and
almost pithy lessons.

Another definition that definition that I think gets close but does not get
exactly correct is:

> A summary of the contents of a book, article, or formal speech.

This definition is incomplete for similar reasons to the previous one, in that
the abstract are not limited to the subjects of the definition. For this one, an
abstract thing does not have to originate from a piece of writing or verbal
communication. The paintings of Jackson Pollock or Pablo Picasso are
innate examples of this fact. Looking at a Picasso is almost a visual summary of
a point in his life where the odd shapes take on non-literal representations of
very real things. What I do like about this definition, however, is that an
abstract thing does in fact originate. I mean, that it comes from some origin
and is almost a reference to that original concept.  Describing abstraction as a
summary embeds this feature into the definition well which is important. So
important in fact that I will come back to this idea later on in this article.

## The Utility of Abstraction

Having a background in software engineering, abstraction is an almost daily
exercise that is inherent to the process of software construction and design.
Unlike other professions that require lots of abstract thinking, the
abstractions of software are often scrutinized and evaluated for their
effectiveness. For writers, musicians, or artists (or any other artistic
practice that has lots of abstraction), abstract thinking will almost never be
called wrong or bad because the end goal is often to evoke emotions which makes
the purpose of abstractions to highlight some piece of information. This is not
how software engineers see it. For programmers, abstraction is much more
reductive which leads to, in my opinion, a much more clear view of the utility gained
from abstract thinking.

The reductive nature of the abstractions in software comes from the size of
systems and our inability to think about all the different states that a system
could be in. So in order to maintain our own sanity, we develop abstract
barriers that hide information.
