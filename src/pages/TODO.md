- write an astro integration that removes that `astro-` prefix from classnames. and make it better than the one I'm [currently using](https://github.com/harrybrwn/harrybrwn.github.io/blob/main/src/lib/configHelpers.js#L44). It should actually parse the html/css without modifying other astro integrations.
- find a remark markdown plugin that will automatically find links to my blog posts so that I don't have to know the link and my build system can do it all for me.
- add a [`/uses`](https://uses.tech/) page to show off all the cool tech that i use
- make my markdown code blocks not so hideous
- add a [spellcheck](https://www.google.com/search?q=spellcheck+github+action) step to CI
- add a vim style command bar to the main page
- add a minimal version of the home page that is under 1kb
